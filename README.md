# annotated-papers :books:
This repository contains all the papers which I read and annotate. The annotated papers and notes are provided here in hopes that those annotations would serve as a summary. The topics are all mostly related to AI/ML and specifically to RL, but there might be some deviation(s).

## Reinforcement Learning
### Generalization in RL

1. [Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/kjanjua26/annotated-papers/blob/main/rl-generalization/decoupling_reps.pdf) (Stooke, Lee, Abbeel, et al.,'21)
2. [Generalization in RL with Selective Noise Injection and Information Bottleneck](https://github.com/kjanjua26/annotated-papers/blob/main/rl-generalization/selective_noise_injection_gen.pdf) (Igl, Ciosek, Li, et al.,'19)
3. [Measuring and Characterizing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/kjanjua26/annotated-papers/blob/main/rl-generalization/measuring_generalization.pdf) (Witty, Lee, Tosch, et al.,'18)


## ML and Brain
### Language

1. [Finding Syntax in Human Encephalography with Beam Search](https://github.com/kjanjua26/annotated-papers/blob/main/ml-and-brain/language/finding_syntax_in_human_encephalography.pdf) (Hale, Dyer, Kuncoro, et al.,'18)
